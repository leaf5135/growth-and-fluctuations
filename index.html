    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <div class="m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
        <p>Welcome to my data viz website! In here, you will be exploring the vast landscape of the U.S. economy through the lens of data visualization. We all know that money plays a crucial role in shaping our world, and recent events such as the tech layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic transformations in cities like San Francisco have captured my attention. I'm passionate about understanding how these economic shifts impact not only my life but also my community.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <div class="m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
        <p>Through thorough analysis of economic data and its historical trajectory, I aim to uncover meaningful patterns that can aid me in navigating future changes with greater insight. Given that economic insights are often communicated through visual representations, this project offers an exciting opportunity to deepen my understanding of both economics and data visualization techniques. Through my engaging narrative and immersive data visualizations, I aim to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the US economy's evolution and dynamics over time.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <div class="m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
        <p>We kick off by delving into the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the past half-century, showcasing its growth trajectory through a visually rich streamgraph. Additionally, I provide a choropleth world map depicting GDP per capita, allowing you to contextualize the US economy within the global landscape.<br><br>Continuing our exploration, I delve into the dynamics of imports and exports using a comprehensive multiline chart. Through paired bar charts featuring sequential color schemes, I dissect major categories of imports and exports for specific years, offering insights into trade patterns and trends.<br><br>Transitioning to the realm of inflation, I present a diverging bar chart showcasing historical inflation rates. By aligning these rates with significant historical events, you gain a deeper understanding of the economic forces at play.<br><br>Furthermore, I investigate unemployment rates, drawing correlations between unemployment and inflation—a commonly discussed economic relationship.<br><br>Last but not least, I unveil a scatterplot comparing inflation rates and unemployment rates, inviting you to explore the validity of the Phillips curve hypothesis, which posits an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment.<br><br>Note that refreshing the page on some of the charts will allow you to see it being created.</p>

    <p>Let's embark on a journey to explore where the US stands in the global economy before diving into its complexities.</p>
    <p>GDP per capita is a measure that divides a country's total GDP by its population. It provides an average of how much economic output each person contributes to the economy. Imagine splitting the national wealth among everyone in the country to see how much each person would get on average. GDP per capita helps compare the economic well-being of different countries by considering population size. A higher GDP per capita generally suggests a higher standard of living, indicating more wealth available per person. It's also useful for tracking changes in average living standards over time within a country.</p>
    <p>As we examine the choropleth map before us, depicting economic trends spanning half a century, we witness the consistent strength of the United States. Over this extensive period, the US economy has shown remarkable stability and growth.</p>

<div class="m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64">
    <p>When we compare the economic output of the United States to other nations, we see something remarkable: our country stands out as a beacon of prosperity. On average, we generate more income than many other countries, placing us among the wealthiest globally.</p>
    <p>Reflecting on this, we realize the privilege of living in a nation with such abundance. But let's not stop there—let's explore the diverse landscape of GDP across industries and government sectors.</p>
    <p>GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product, which measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders over a specific period, like a year or a quarter. It's like adding up everything the country makes, from cars to clothes to services like haircuts and doctor visits. GDP helps economists understand how big and healthy an economy is. A high GDP usually means a strong economy with lots of production and spending, while a low GDP might suggest economic challenges like recession or slow growth. We use GDP to compare how different countries are doing economically or to track changes over time.</p>
    <p>GDP varies across sectors and government levels: State and Local Government GDP includes spending on things like education and roads within their areas; Federal Government GDP covers spending on defense, welfare, and infrastructure; Investments GDP includes spending on assets like stocks and real estate; Services GDP covers things like healthcare and finance; Goods GDP involves making tangible products like cars and crops. Understanding these differences helps us measure economic performance and make informed decisions for growth.</p>

    <p>Looking at the graph, we notice something interesting: the services sector generates much more GDP than both state and federal governments combined. This shows how important the services industry is for our economy.</p>
    <p>Also, the graph shows that GDP has been growing rapidly over time. This tells us that our economy is expanding quickly. It makes us wonder if this trend will continue in the future. Our economy is always changing and evolving, sparking curiosity and questions.</p>

            What are the ins and outs?

<div class="m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64">
    <p>Now, as we journey through the halls of knowledge, let us delve into the intricate world of the US trade. Within this fascinating realm lie the fundamental concepts of imports and exports.</p>
    <p>Imports and exports are like buying and selling between countries. When the US imports, it means it's buying stuff from other countries. These can be things like clothes, electronics, or even cars. Imports come into the US from other places.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, when the US exports, it's selling stuff to other countries. This can be anything from food to technology. Exported stuff leaves the US and goes to other countries.</p>
    <p>The trade balance is about the difference between imports and exports. If the US imports more than it exports, it's called a trade deficit. If it exports more than it imports, it's called a trade surplus.</p>
    <p>When there's a trade deficit, it means the US is spending more money on imports than it's earning from exports. This can impact the economy because it means more money is going out of the country than coming in.</p>
    <p>When there's a trade surplus, it means the US is making more money from exports than it's spending on imports. This can be good for the economy because it brings in more money from other countries.</p>

    <p>Have you noticed the sharp decline in the years 2008 and 2009? That dip coincided with the 2008 market crash, sending shockwaves through the global economy. As a result, both US imports and exports took a hit, causing ripple effects felt around the world.</p>
    <p>See how imports consistently outweigh exports? That's a sign of a trade deficit! The difference between imports and exports is negative, indicating that the US is spending more on imports than it's earning from exports.</p>
    <p>Now, let's dive into the different things the US buys and sells. We've got everyday stuff like electronics and clothes, which we call "general merchandise". Then there's food, drinks, and animal feed. Think grains, meats, and beverages.</p>
    <p>For building and making things, there are raw materials like metals and machinery, called "industrial supplies and materials". We also invest in big equipment and machinery for businesses to grow, known as "capital goods except automotive".</p>
    <p>When it comes to cars and trucks, as well as their parts and engines, that's another big part of what we trade. Finally, there's all the stuff people buy for themselves, from gadgets to clothes, called "consumer goods except food and automotive".</p>

    <p>If you've played around with the year dropdown, you might have noticed something interesting: the amount of money involved in trade has shot up over the decades. The maximum value increases by over a trillion dollars!</p>
    <p>Now, let's take a closer look at the types of goods being traded. General merchandise seems to be leading the pack in both imports and exports. This could be because general merchandise includes a wide variety of products that people use every day, like electronics, clothing, and household items. These items are in high demand globally, driving significant trade volumes in both directions.</p>
